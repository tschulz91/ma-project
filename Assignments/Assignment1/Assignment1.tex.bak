\maketitle

I would like to make my research paper a data science/big data project. Academically, my interests lie mostly in econometrics and anything data related but I would also like to go beyond the traditional econometric tool set and apply methods from the field of data science such as machine learning and other predictive models. I do not yet have a specific research question in mind. Instead, I have some data sets that I would like to work with. Ideally, the data would be coming from the technology sector as I am interested in working in that industry later on.
